- ALWAYS dump what you're gonna do to TODO.md in project root.
    - TODO.md does checkpoint and interconnects between user and you (agent). It's important to dump TODO that other users or agents can jump right into where you left undone.
    - Normally you don't need to ask users to review TODO, BUT if user asked to "plan it" explicitly, ask user to review TODO before continuing.
    - User may manually edit this file. Always consult the file before processing new user prompts.
    - Section order: TODO (user appends new task here so process them and move to appropriate sections below), Future Enhancements, Skipped, Completed.
    - Do not get rid of skipped todos, move them to skipped section with explanation.
- User may left comments in files that contains "@claude"
    - Always do what that comment asks and erase it when done.
    - When user says `reviewed`, `continue` or something similar, it means you need to check and process these review comments.
- files under `.worktrees` or `worktree` are git worktree and must be ignored.
